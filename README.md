# analytical-geometry-on-the-plane

Write a class library for analytic geometry on a plane.
   The following concepts need to be supported: 
point, line, segment, ray,polygon (a set of segments).
   You can do the following: 
move, rotate relative to the center of coordinates, 
to calculate the intersection, the distance between objects, 
for closed shapes-calculate the perimeter and the square.
It is necessary to implement only the creation of objects and calculations, without drawing (visualization).
